# gatsby-starter-magicsoup
The GatsbyJS Starter with our react component library soup. - Just add some water!

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    gatsby new my-magicsoup-starter https://github.com/magicsoup-io/gatsby-starter-magicsoup
    npm install 
    ## Or use yarn as a package manager if you prefer. 
    ```

## What's special about our magicsoup.io starter?

1.  **`instant-soup`**: This starter is based on the GatsbyJS default starter, but has our magicsoup.io/stock module included! So you can use it in your templates, compontents, views.

2.  **`no-more-noodels`**: Say good-bye to spaghetti code! Keep

3.  **`hot-and-spicy`**: This starter will always use the most recent version of magicsoup.io.
